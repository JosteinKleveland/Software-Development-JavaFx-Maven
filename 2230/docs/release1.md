# Dokumentasjon - Release 1

### Getting started

In the first of our regular meetings (which planned in our group contract), we came up with the idea of creating a "weekly calendar". An application one could use to get an overview of - and edit - activities happening on a weekly basis. We chose this, because such an application would be able store information - such that it is retrievable from different devices or at a later point in time - and has the potential to expand in complexity and functionality. 


### Solving the assignment

To get a sense of the final product, and what to work towards, we created some "userstories". However, at this point, insecurity about what to document (inc. usages of commit messages and Gitlab), and how to document it was of hindrance to start coding. Nonetheless, after our meeting with a TA, this became clearer and we began creating a backlog of issues and distributing tasks to individual team members. It was important for us to become familiar with Gitlab and how to use the different tools for project/code management.

Emphazising quality > quantity, we decided to keep the functionality very simple for the first release and focus on quality of code, setting up a functioning framework, and getting familiar with the tools we are using. After writing a decent backlog of issues (related to the first release), we started to divide areas of responsiblity. We started with the most fundamental issues and created new ones when encountered significant problems. For storing the info of the calendars we decided to use JSON - being easy-to-parse, lightweight, and text-based. 

### The road ahead

As we are now more familiar with Gitlab, we seek to take full advantage of it to optimize our work-flow and collaborative work up ahead. 

As a group, we will to continue to meet regularly and work in sprints, distributing responsibilities among team members, and help each other.
